# odin-recipes

<!-- I'm not good at english but i'm trying to understand everything but sometimes the message or instruction are confusing -->

building odin project's recipe project

DONE!!!

Struggled for a bit because of some misunderstanding (english reading comprehension funny moment)

---

I struggled in img path, Because i forgot to add ./ and ../ i forgot that you need to go back and forth.
so yeah it took me 3 and a Half hours.
Half hour of trying to understand the Instruction.
2 Hours of trying to Git Reset and end up Git Reset back to Zero.
and 1 hour of Finishing the Project after realizing that i'm stupid.
