<!-- I'm not good at english but i'm trying to understand everything but sometimes the message or instruction are confusing -->

building odin project's recipe project

DONE!!!

Struggled for a bit because of some misunderstanding (english comprehension funny moment)

I struggled in img path because i forgot to add ./ and ../ i forgot that you need to go back if the path are not the same

so yeah it took me 3 and a Half hours.

Half hour of trying to understand the Instruction

2 Hours of trying to Git Reset and end up Git Reset back to Zero hahahaha

and 1 hour of Finishing the Project after realizing that i'm stupid
